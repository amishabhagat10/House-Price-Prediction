# 🏡 Codveda Internship – Level 2 Task 1: Regression Analysis

Welcome! This repository contains my submission for Level 2 Task 1 of the Codveda Internship program. In this project, I applied Linear Regression to predict house prices using the Boston Housing dataset.

---

## 📌 Task Overview

Objective: 
Perform a simple linear regression analysis to predict one variable (target) based on another using real-world data.

Dataset Used: 
House Prediction Dataset (Boston Housing Data)

Key Steps:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature selection and correlation analysis
- Model training with Linear Regression
- Model evaluation using R² score and Mean Squared Error
- Data visualization for insights

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python   
- Pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

## 📊 Results

The model performed well in predicting house prices with a decent R² score. Key features such as `RM` (average number of rooms per dwelling) showed strong positive correlation with the target `MEDV` (Median value of owner-occupied homes).

## 💡 Learnings

- Improved understanding of linear regression and data preprocessing  
- Learned to visualize feature relationships effectively  
- Gained experience using scikit-learn for model building and evaluation
